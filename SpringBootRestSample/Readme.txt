Principles of REST

    Resources expose easily understood directory structure URIs.
    Representations transfer JSON or XML to represent data objects and attributes.
    Messages use HTTP methods explicitly (for example, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
    Stateless interactions store no client context on the server between requests. State dependencies limit and restrict scalability. The client holds session state.
 
 
 REST is an architectural style for designing distributed systems.
